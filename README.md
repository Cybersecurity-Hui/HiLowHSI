## **ðŸš€ HiLoHSI: Efficient HSI Classification via High-Low Frequency Hybrid Quantization**  
### **ðŸ“Œ Introduction**  
HiLoHSI is a novel dual-path general framework for lightweight hyperspectral image (HSI) classification. It innovatively combines high-low frequency decoupling and hybrid quantization to reduce overhead while ensuring accuracy.
